Treat infrastrcuture as code as a Software development project. Implementing software engineering practices into the development of infrastructure.

Version Control


[The Practical Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html)

Unit-Test - static analysis, 
Integration-Test - Test if your deployment works, clean environment, random variables, different locations
E2E-Test - Testing accross components
Acceptance Test - Validation of deployment

Pipelines CI/CD, build pipelein -> artefacts -> release pipeline

Innterloop and Outerloop

Testing:

Assumption:
            Big Components that have dependencies

Build Pipeline
            static analyse
            Unit Test
                        Test-
                        WhatIf
            Integration Test?
                        integration
                        dependencies
                        mÃ¼ssen bedingungen da sein (Hub/Tier1)
-> Bauen eines Artefacts
Release Pipeline
            Smoke Tests
            Validation Test
            Acceptence Test

Inner-Loop (View of Developer)
            Liniting - .vscode/extensions/ json lint but is there a lint on the pipeline
            convention/formating  - .vscode/settings (trim whitepsace, new line, brackets, tabs)
            
            Execution of tests locally
            code generators
